<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, my name is Karla. I am a software developer in sunny Florida! I recently completed by Bachlor of Science in Computer Software Technology from the University of Arizona Global Campus. I am eager to continue learning new technologies and improving my skills in this amazing field for a company who is willing to nurture my talents and apetite to learn.

  My passion for technology ignited when my parents first brought home an Intel desktop in the late 1990s. My curiosity grew as I learned more about using the giant machine - from unwiring and rewiring the system, exploring computer files and how to access, delete and disable folder access from my sibling, to eventually learning how to install games like Zoo Tycoon and accessing the internet via a dialup connection. In highschool, I took an HTML class where I learned to created my first static website using nothing but HTML. In college, I worked for the Office of Information Technology as a troubleshooter for students, faculty, and staff at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Upon graduation I began working for NCIS Pearon Inc which introduced me to project management and development. In 2017, I took a job at USAA as an insurance agent in hopes to pursue an education and career in software engineering.

  When I'm not on my computer, you can find me exploring the beautiful landscapes of Florida on a kayak or a bike, catching the most recent film at the local theater, or working on my next sewing project!
