<h1> The Best Movies According to Karla! </h1>
<h2> My top 3 favorite movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Pan's Labyrinth</h3>
<p>
    One of Guillermo del Toro's best films in my opinion, which follows the life of a young girl in Spain during the begining stages of an authoritative dictorship in 1944. The film uses Ofelia's vivid imagination to portray the opression she lives day-by-day under the rule of her new stepfather, Captail Vidal, who is an officer in Franco's army. The line between what is real and not is blurred as Guillermo provides a beautifully contrasting dark fairy tell on how Ofelia process the horror's that she experiences in her childhood.

<h3>Daybreakers</h3>
<p> 
    Daybreakers is not your typical vampire film. It takes place in the future after the world has been overun by vampires and humans have become the most valuable resource on the planet. As vampires race to find more humans in a world that is killing them extinct, humans race to find a cure for vampirism.

<h3>The Orphanage</h3>
<p>
    Another one of Guillermo del Toro's masterpieces, the Orphanage is my favorite horror film. It is a ghost story that takes place in Spain through the eyes and memories of Laura who returns to her hometown where she was raised in an orphage. The film walks us through some terrifying events of what might have occured to her and her playmates while living in the orphanage.
